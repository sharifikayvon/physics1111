Welcome to the **PHYS 1111 Data Analysis Tools** app! This website was designed to streamline students' daily data visualization and analysis tasks for Dr. Barooni's PHYS 1111 course.
- **Graph and Fit your Data**: Make a scatter plot of your data and fit a linear or quadratic function.
- **Visualize 1D Motion**: Define x(t), v(t), or a(t) and visualize all three!

Explore the tools using the sidebar on the left! If you have any questions or feedback, please email me at ksharifi1@gsu.edu.

More features to be added soon. Stay tuned!
